All credit goes to tomas123, cynfab etc from that forum who did the awesome research and work to make this support.

### Add Support for FLIR ONE G3 Cameras

The branch g3 of this fork adds support for FLIR ONE G3 cameras (it may also work with PRO LT models), that have a sensor with 80x60 resolution.

It also adds some command line options, that can be displayed by running the program without any arguments.
The `--pro` flag should make it compatible with FLIR ONE G2 and PRO models, although I don't have one of those to test.
